/**
 * UnitConverter describes how to convert a unit to and from the base unit of its dimension.

     * The following methods perform conversions to and from the base unit of a unit class's dimension.
     * Each unit is defined against the base unit for the dimension to which the unit belongs.
     *
     * These methods are implemented differently depending on the type of conversion.
     * The default implementation in UnitConverter simply returns the value.
     *
     * These methods exist for the sole purpose of creating custom conversions for units in order to
     * support converting a value from one kind of unit to another in the same dimension.
     * UnitConverter is an abstract class that is meant to be subclassed.
     * There is no need to call these methods directly to do a conversion -- the correct way to convert
     * a measurement is to use [Measurement measurementByConvertingToUnit:].
     * measurementByConvertingToUnit: uses the following 2 methods internally to perform the conversion.
     *
     * When creating a custom unit converter, you must override these two methods to implement the conversion to and from a
     * value in terms of a unit and the corresponding value in terms of the base unit of that unit's dimension in order for conversion to work correctly.
